      Like a <b>pair</b> of inquisitive sleuths on a
      <u
        ><b><i>crime scene</i></b></u
      >, Brendon McCullum and Jonny Bairstow squeezed through the ropes strung
      around the 22-yard strip and devoted the next 20 minutes deducing its
      nature. The duo bent, kneeled and craned their necks, probing the surface
      from every possible angle. <span> Root and Ollie Pope</span>, too, joined
      them in their forensic examination, <br />even as the two national
      curators and the local counterpart watched bemusedly from their pitch-side
      <hr />
      perch.
